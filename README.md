## ModeStart - A Kickstart for the people, of the people, by the people.

ModeStart, the next evolution in crowdfunding. Built on the ModeTestnet with Sepolia, our platform leverages the best of blockchain technology to bring your ideas and investments to life. Security and simplicity go hand in hand with MetaMask wallet authentication. Engage with ModeStart seamlessly, knowing your identity and transactions are protected every step of the way.

Built with a combination of vision, dedication, and cutting-edge technology. We started by mapping out the user journey, ensuring that both project creators and backers have a smooth and intuitive experience. Our smart contracts were then meticulously crafted using Solidity and tested extensively in Remix to ensure maximum security and efficiency. React was chosen for the front end to create an engaging and responsive interface that reflects the innovation of the projects we aim to support.
